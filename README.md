# super-assignment

This application connects to a fictional social media network. One endpoint registers a token and the other endpoint fetches posts made by fictional users across a 6 month period.

## Dependencies

You should be running PHP 8.0+, the latest version of composer and available to use command line on your machine for any commands listed below. How you run PHP is up to you!

* `guzzlehttp/guzzle` - to make API calls
* `symfony/cache` - not to disturb the API much
* `vlucas/phpdotenv` - to keep some config data out of files

## Local setup

**1. Setup .env file:** Copy `/.env.example` to `/.env`. Add required settings there. Finding out the required settings is part of the assignment.

**2. Run docker-compose:**
To build the container to run the assignment in, run command `docker-compose up --build`. This will create container `php_assignment` in Docker project `supermetrics`.

The container will be listening on port `7777` on your `localhost`.

**Note:** Locally changed files will not be updated to the Docker container automatically as mirroring is not enabled. This means you will need to run `docker-compose` again to update the files inside the container.

## Run application
Application can be reached from the localhost: 
[http://localhost:7777](http://localhost:7777) - shows the main page.

## Testing

**Run tests:**

1. **Connect to container:**
Connect to container by running command `docker exec -it php_assignment /bin/bash`.

2. **Change path:**
Previous command should take you to path `/app`, but make sure of that by running command `cd /app`.

4. **Run tests:**
Run the tests with command `./vendor/bin/phpunit`.
